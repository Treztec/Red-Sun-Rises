Red-Sun-Rises
=============

The Red Sun Rises is an unfamiliar twist on a familiar genre, inspired by well known indie titles like Minecraft and Terraria, and not so well known indie titles such as Starbound, Xenominer, and Murder Miners. TRSR is a 3D Voxel-based Sandbox, intending to travel the depths of space in various habitats.
